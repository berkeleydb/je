<title>Triggers</title>

<body>
<p>
NOT YET RELEASED: Triggers provide a mechanism for automatically executing one
or more application defined trigger methods whenever a certain type of
operation is performed. The mechanism is automatic in that the method is
invoked automatically by JE and not the application.
</p>
<p>
All the trigger methods are, in the terminology generally associated
with RDBMS triggers, <em>after</em> triggers. An <em>after</em> trigger
method is only invoked after the successful completion of the
associated operation. It is not invoked if the operation associated
with the trigger method fails.
</p>
<p>
The trigger interfaces are organized so that the application can easily choose
to implement the minimal set of methods that meet their needs. 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Trigger defines the methods that must be implemented by simple 
trigger applications in a standalone JE environment that only make changes to 
the JE environment in the scope of the transaction supplied to the trigger 
method.
</li>
<li>ReplicatedDatabaseTrigger introduces additional methods that must be
implemented by the application so that it can deal correctly with
multiple invocations of a trigger per operation as a result of <em>Syncup</em>
operations on a Replica.</li>
<li>
Finally, TransactionTrigger defines trigger methods for transaction commit and
abort operations. They are intended for use by sophisticated applications that 
maintain state outside of JE, for example, in a transient cache, or in an RDBMS.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Each of the interfaces described above defines a set of trigger
methods that must all work together to achieve a common purpose. The
application must typically supply non-null implementations for all the
methods in an interface or the application will likely be incomplete.
</p>
<h3>Configuring Triggers</h3>
<p>
Triggers are configured via the get/set methods defined on
<em>DatabaseConfig</em>. They are stored persistently in the
database. If the database is replicated, the association is replicated
at each node, so that the triggers can be run there as well.
</p>

<h3>Trigger Invocation</h3>

<p>
Multiple uniquely named Trigger instances may be associated with the
same database. In such cases, the triggers are
invoked in the order specified by the list argument to the trigger
setting methods defined by <em>DatabaseConfig</em>.
</p>
<p>
If the invocation of a trigger results in a runtime exception, the
transaction (if one was associated with the method) is invalidated and any
subsequent triggers also associated with the operation are skipped. It's the
caller's responsibility to handle the exception and abort the invalidated
transaction.
</p>
The implementation of a trigger method may result in the invocation of
additional trigger methods. It's the application's responsibility to
ensure that the use of cascading triggers does not create an infinite
recursion.
<p>
Trigger methods are not synchronized. It's up to the application to
make any necessary provisions for synchronization. On a related note,
a trigger method should not make any assumptions about the thread of
control in which it is invoked. That is, it may be invoked in the same
thread of control as the triggering operation, or it may be invoked in
a different thread.
</p>
Trigger methods are expected to be lightweight. If they are required
to do substantial work, it may be best to queue the work so that the
method returns quickly and the bulk of the work is accomplished
asynchronously.

<h3>Trigger Methods and Transactions</h3>

<p>
A trigger method takes a transaction as its first argument. The
argument is not null if the environment is transactional. The non-null
transaction argument to trigger methods defined by Trigger is always
valid and can be used by the method to make transactional changes. The
non-null transaction argument passed to the commit and abort triggers
associated with TransactionTrigger is no longer valid and cannot be
used to make transactional changes.
</p>
<p>
The transactional context associated with the code executing in a
trigger is exactly the same as that associated with any JE application
code; it is subject to exactly the same restrictions. For example, a
trigger method associated with a DatabaseTrigger executed on a replica
cannot make any modifications to a replicated database using the
transaction supplied to it. It can however modify local databases.
