      <p>
    This section builds on the prior section describing secondary
	key indices to show how to open foreign key indices. A <span class="emphasis"><em>foreign
	key index</em></span> is a secondary key index that also provides integrity
	constraints. When the primary key of a record in one database is
	embedded in the value of a record in another database, integrity
	constraints ensure that the record in the first database exists,
	i.e, that there are no "dangling pointers". In this example the
	Shipment's PartNumber and SupplierNumber fields will be used as
	foreign keys.
</p>
      <p>
    When a foreign key index is defined, an "delete action"
	parameter is specified. This parameter determines what action is
	taken by the 
        <span>Berkeley DB Java Edition</span>
        
    API when the record is deleted to
	which a foreign key refers. For example, consider what happens to a
	Shipment record when a Part or Supplier record that is referred to
	by that Shipment is deleted. There are three possibilities.
</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            <p>
            <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/ForeignKeyDeleteAction.html#ABORT" target="_top">ForeignKeyDeleteAction.ABORT</a>
            
            specifies that the transaction should be aborted by throwing an
            exception. The effect is that deleting a Part or Supplier that is
            referred to by one or more Shipments will not be possible. The 
                <span>Berkeley DB Java Edition</span>
                
            will automatically throw a 
                <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/DatabaseException.html" target="_top">DatabaseException</a>,
            which should normally cause the transaction to be aborted during
            exception processing. This is the default delete action if none is
            specified.
        </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
            <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/ForeignKeyDeleteAction.html#NULLIFY" target="_top">ForeignKeyDeleteAction.NULLIFY</a>
            
            specifies that the Part or Supplier Number field in the Shipment
            record should be cleared, or set to a null or empty value. The
            effect is that the deleted Part or Supplier will no longer be
            referenced by any Shipment record. This option applies when the
            foreign key field is optional, i.e, when the application allows it
            to be set to a null or empty value. When using this option, the
            application must implement the <code class="methodname">nullifyForeignKey()</code> 
            method of the 
            <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/ForeignKeyNullifier.html" target="_top">ForeignKeyNullifier</a>
            
            interface.

          <li>
            <p>
            <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/ForeignKeyDeleteAction.html#CASCADE" target="_top">ForeignKeyDeleteAction.CASCADE</a>
            
            specifies that the Shipment record should be deleted also. The
            effect is that deleting a Part or Supplier will delete all
            Shipments for that Part or Supplier. This option applies when the
            deleted record is considered the "parent" or "owner" of the record
            containing the foreign key, and is used in this example. Since
            deleting the Shipment record could cause other deletions if other
            records contain the foreign key of the Shipment, and so on, the
            term "cascade" is used to describe the effect.

    If you compare these statements for opening foreign key indices
	to the statements used in the previous section for opening a
	secondary index, you'll notice that the only significant difference
	is that the <code class="methodname">setForeignKeyDatabase()</code>
    and
	<code class="methodname">setForeignKeyDeleteAction()</code> methods are called.
	<code class="methodname">setForeignKeyDatabase()</code> specifies the foreign database that
	contains the records to which the foreign keys refer; this
	configures the secondary database as a foreign key index.
	<code class="methodname">setForeignKeyDeleteAction()</code> specifies the delete action.
</p>
      <p>
    The application-defined <code class="classname">ShipmentByPartKeyCreator</code>
    and <code class="classname">ShipmentBySupplierKeyCreator</code> classes are shown below. They
	were used above to configure the secondary database objects.

    The key creator classes above are almost identical to the one
	defined in the previous section for use with a secondary index. The
	index key fields are different, of course, but the interesting
	difference is that the index keys are extracted from the key, not
	the value, of the Shipment record. This illustrates that an index
	key may be derived from the primary database record key, value, or
	both.
</p>
      <p>
    Note that the 
    <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bind/serial/SerialSerialKeyCreator.html#nullifyForeignKey" target="_top">SerialSerialKeyCreator.nullifyForeignKey</a>
    
    method is not
	overridden above. This is because 
    <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/ForeignKeyDeleteAction.html#NULLIFY" target="_top">ForeignKeyDeleteAction.NULLIFY</a>
    
	was not used when creating the 
    <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/SecondaryDatabase.html" target="_top">SecondaryDatabase</a>
    
	objects. If it were used, implementing the <code class="methodname">nullifyForeignKey()</code>
	methods would be needed to set the part number and supplier number
	to null in the Shipment key. But record keys cannot be changed! And
	in fact, the primary key is not passed to the
	<code class="methodname">SerialSerialKeyCreator.nullifyForeignKey()</code> method, only the
	primary value is passed. Therefore, if a foreign index key is
	derived from the primary key, 
    <a class="ulink" href="../../java/com/sleepycat/je/ForeignKeyDeleteAction.html#NULLIFY" target="_top">ForeignKeyDeleteAction.NULLIFY</a>
    
	may not be used.
