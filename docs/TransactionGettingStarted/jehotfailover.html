      <p>
            As a final backup/recovery strategy, you can create a hot failover. Note that using hot failovers requires
            your application to be able to specify its environment home directory at application startup time. Most
            application developers allow the environment home directory to be identified using a command line option or a
            configuration or properties file. If your application has its
            environment home hard-coded into it, you cannot use hot failovers.
        </p>
      <p>
            You create a hot failover by periodically
            backing up your database to an alternative location on disk. Usually this
            alternative location is on a separate physical drive from where you normally keep your database, but if
            multiple drives are not available then you should at least put the hot failover on a separate disk
            partition.
        </p>
      <p>
            You failover by causing your application to reopen its environment using the failover
            location.
        </p>
      <p>
            Note that a hot failover should not be used as a substitute for backing up and archiving
            your data to a safe location physically remote from your computing environment. Even if
            your data is spread across multiple physical disks, a truly serious catastrophe (fires,
            malevolent software viruses, faulty disk controllers, and so forth) can still cause you
            to lose your data. 
        </p>
      <p>
            To create and maintain a hot failover:
        </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                        Copy all log files (<code class="filename">*.jdb</code>) from your environment
                        directory to the location where you want to keep your failover.  Either an
                        offline or a hot backup can be used for this purpose, but typically a hot
                        failoveris initially created by taking an offline backup of your database.
                        This ensures that you have captured the contents of your in-memory cache.
                    </p>
            <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
              <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
              <p>
                            If you are using subdirectories to store your log files, then you must backup
                            the subdirectories, making sure to keep log files in the subdirectory in which
                            JE placed them. For information on using subdirectories to store your log
                            files, see the <em class="citetitle">Getting Started with Berkeley DB, Java Edition</em> guide.
                        </p>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Periodically copy to your failover directory any log files that were changed or created since the
                    time of your last copy. Most backup software is capable of performing this kind of an incremental
                    backup for you. 
                </p>
            <p>
                    Note that the frequency of your incremental copies determines the amount of data
                    that is at risk due to catastrophic failures. For example, if you perform the
                    incremental copy once an hour then at most your hot failover is an hour behind
                    your production database, and so you are risking at most an hours worth of
                    database changes.
                </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                    Remove any <code class="filename">*.jdb</code> files from the hot failover directory that have been removed or
                    renamed to <code class="filename">.del</code> files in the primary directory.  This is not necessary for
                    consistency, but will help to reduce disk space consumed by the hot failover.
                </p>
